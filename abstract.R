# ABSTRACT

This report investigates the transmission of West Nile Virus through birds and mosquitoes in Salt Lake City and whether House Finches are a key amplifying species. Previously, an experimental infection study had identified several species of birds, including House Finches, as being better amplifying hosts than others due to their ability to develop high viremia levels. Komar et al. (2003). To determine the relationship between House Finches and mosquitos in the transmission of WNV, bloodmeal data from WNV positive and negative locations was analyzed using linear regression tests. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that House Finches are key amplifiers of WNV transmission due to both their ability to develop higher viremia levels than other species and the finding that House Finches are a common bloodmeal for mosquitoes in WNV positive areas.
